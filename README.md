The first programming riddle on the rest

# About

[Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) is a game in which each level can be solved by a bit of (Python) programming.

The Python Challenge was written by Nadav Samet.

All levels can be solved by straightforward and very short1 scripts.

Python Challenge welcomes programmers of all languages. You will be able to solve most riddles in any programming language, but some of them will require Python.

Sometimes you'll need extra modules. All can be downloaded for free from the internet.

It is just for fun - nothing waits for you at the end.

Keep the scripts you write - they might become useful.
